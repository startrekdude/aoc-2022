# My Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Organized in a fairly self-explanatory way; `01` has the first day and so on. My main language is Python. I'll try to comment anything that isn't obvious but ultimately I am going for time so please excuse bad code quality. Let's save Christmas!

## Times

| Day # | Part 1     | Part 2     |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Day 1 | `00:02:30` | `00:03:25` |
| Day 2 | `00:11:28` | `00:13:52` |
| Day 3 | `00:03:51` | `00:06:47` |
| Day 4 | `00:03:54` | `00:05:36` |
